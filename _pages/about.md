The Computational Logic Center at The University of Iowa seeks to advance the theory and practice of correct software development, by applying techniques from logic, programming languages, and automated theorem proving.

Our primary research areas are foundations of programming languages, type theory, computer-aided verification, automated reasoning, computer security and privacy.
